# Pixel-Perfect Visual Regression Testing

Compare UI screenshots pixel-by-pixel against a baseline. Catch unintended visual changes. Built on `@playwright/test` — no third-party services.

## Step 1: Check State

Run all three commands, then use the table to choose your workflow.

```bash
ls playwright.config.ts 2>/dev/null && echo "CONFIG_EXISTS" || echo "CONFIG_MISSING"
find snapshots/ -name "*.png" 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -q . && echo "BASELINES_EXIST" || echo "BASELINES_MISSING"
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^2" && echo "SERVER_OK" || echo "NO_SERVER"
```

| Config | Baselines | Server | → Do this |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| CONFIG_MISSING | any | any | **→ Workflow A** (Full Setup) |
| CONFIG_EXISTS | BASELINES_MISSING | SERVER_OK | **→ Workflow B** (Capture Baseline) |
| CONFIG_EXISTS | BASELINES_EXIST | SERVER_OK | Run `npx playwright test`. If tests fail → see **Step 2**. |
| CONFIG_EXISTS | BASELINES_EXIST | NO_SERVER | STOP. Tell the user: "Dev server not running on :3000. Start it first, then re-check." |
| CONFIG_EXISTS | BASELINES_MISSING | NO_SERVER | STOP. Tell the user: "No baselines and no dev server. Start the server first." |

Do not guess the next step — use the table.

## Step 2: If Tests Fail

Only consult this section after running `npx playwright test` and seeing a failure.

```
What kind of failure?
│
├─ "screenshot doesn't match" / snapshot diff
│  │
│  │  STOP. Ask the user:
│  │  "Was this visual change intentional (design update) or unexpected (possible bug)?"
│  │  Wait for an explicit answer — do NOT infer from context.
│  │  If the answer is ambiguous, ask again: "Please answer 'intentional' or 'bug'."
│  │
│  ├─ "Intentional" → Workflow C: Update Baseline
│  └─ "Bug" / "Unexpected" → Workflow D: Debug Comparison
│
├─ Tests flaky (pass sometimes, fail sometimes)
│  └─ → Workflow E: Fix Flakiness with Fixture
│
└─ Config errors / tests won't run
   └─ Check Node.js version (v18+), re-run `npx playwright install chromium`
```

---

## Workflow A: Full Setup

**Exit condition:** `npx playwright test --list` prints test names without errors.

**Step 1.** Check for existing `package.json`:
```bash
ls package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"
```
If MISSING: run `npm init -y` first. If EXISTS: skip — do not re-initialize.

**Step 2.** Install Playwright:
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install chromium
```
If this fails: check `node -v` — requires v18+.

**Step 3.** Ask the user: "What URL does your dev server run on? (e.g. http://localhost:3000)"
Wait for their answer. You will need it for Step 4.

**Step 4.** Write the config file. Use the Read tool to load the template:
Read file: `~/.claude/skills/pixel-perfect/references/examples/playwright.config.ts`
Write it to: `./playwright.config.ts`
Then update `baseURL` to the URL the user provided in Step 3.

**Step 5.** Write the test file:
Read file: `~/.claude/skills/pixel-perfect/references/examples/visual.spec.ts`
Write it to: `./tests/visual.spec.ts`

**Step 6.** Verify setup is functional:
```bash
npx playwright test --list
```
If this errors: show the output to the user and stop. Do not proceed to Workflow B.

**Workflow A complete** → continue to **Workflow B**.

---

## Workflow B: Capture Baseline

**Exit condition:** `find snapshots/ -name "*.png" | wc -l` prints a non-zero number and snapshots are committed to git.

**Step 1.** Verify the dev server responds:
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000
```
Expected: `200`. If not 200: STOP. Tell the user the server is not responding (code: X) and ask them to start it.

**Step 2.** Check if Docker is available:
```bash
docker --version 2>/dev/null && echo "DOCKER_OK" || echo "NO_DOCKER"
```

If DOCKER_OK — capture inside Docker (matches Linux CI, avoids font rendering diffs):
```bash
docker run --rm --ipc=host -v $(pwd):/work -w /work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.50.1-noble \
  npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

If NO_DOCKER — ask the user:
> "Docker is not available. Baselines captured locally on macOS can cause false CI failures due to font rendering differences. Do you want to proceed locally (acceptable if you won't use CI), or install Docker first?"
Wait for their answer before proceeding. If they confirm local: run `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`.

**Step 3.** Verify snapshots were created:
```bash
find snapshots/ -name "*.png" | wc -l
```
If output is `0` or command errors: STOP. Show the user the test output and ask to debug.

**Step 4.** Commit baselines:
```bash
git add snapshots/ && git commit -m "chore: add visual baselines"
```

**Workflow B complete.** Baselines are now the source of truth.

---

## Workflow C: Update Baseline

Use when a design change is intentional and the current baseline is outdated.

**Before Step 1.** Ask the user:
> "What is the reason for updating these baselines? (e.g., 'updated button design', 'new header font')"
Wait for their answer. Save it. You will use it in Step 3. Do not proceed until you have a clear answer.

**Step 1.** Check if Docker is available:
```bash
docker --version 2>/dev/null && echo "DOCKER_OK" || echo "NO_DOCKER"
```

If DOCKER_OK — update snapshots inside Docker:
```bash
docker run --rm --ipc=host -v $(pwd):/work -w /work \
  mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.50.1-noble \
  npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```
Docker step updates all existing baselines AND creates new ones. Skip Step 2.

If NO_DOCKER — add only new baselines locally (do not overwrite existing ones):
```bash
npx playwright test --update-snapshots=missing
```

**Step 2.** (Docker only) Skip this step — Docker already updated everything.
(Local only) Already done in Step 1.

**Step 3.** Commit with the reason the user gave you:
```bash
git add snapshots/ && git commit -m "chore: update visual baselines — USER_REASON"
```
Replace `USER_REASON` with the exact answer from the user. Do not invent a reason. If the user's reason contains single quotes or special characters, ask for a simpler version.

> ⚠️ Never auto-update snapshots in CI. Use the [update-snapshots workflow](.github/workflows/update-snapshots.yml) for intentional updates — it requires a reason and commits with attribution.

---

## Workflow D: Debug Comparison

**Step 1.** Run tests and capture output:
```bash
npx playwright test 2>&1 | tail -30
```

**Step 2.** Find diff images (CLI-friendly — no browser needed):
```bash
find playwright-report/ -name "*-diff.png" -o -name "*-actual.png" 2>/dev/null | head -20
find test-results/ -name "*.png" 2>/dev/null | head -20
```
Show the user the list of diff image paths. Ask them to open the files to see what changed.

**Step 3.** If the user has a browser available, they can run the HTML report themselves:
```
npx playwright show-report
```
Do NOT run `show-report` yourself — it starts a web server and blocks the terminal indefinitely.

## Workflow E: Fix Flakiness with Fixture

For pages with custom fonts, JS animations (Framer Motion, GSAP), or lazy-loaded images.

**Step 1.** Copy fixture to your project using the Read and Write tools:
Read file: `~/.claude/skills/pixel-perfect/references/fixtures/visual.ts`
Write it to: `./tests/fixtures/visual.ts`

**Step 2.** In your test file (e.g. `tests/visual.spec.ts`), find the import line:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
```
Replace it with:
```typescript
import { test, expect, waitForPageReady } from './fixtures/visual';
```
(Adjust the relative path if your test file is in a different location.)

**Step 3.** In every test that calls `toHaveScreenshot()`, add these two lines immediately before the `toHaveScreenshot` call:
```typescript
await page.locator('h1').waitFor();   // replace h1 with the key element for this page
await waitForPageReady(page);         // fonts + images + GSAP freeze
```

The fixture uses `addInitScript` (runs before any app JS) to:
- Mock `IntersectionObserver` (lazy loaders fire immediately)
- Set `window.__PLAYWRIGHT__ = true` (for Framer Motion / app-level animation disabling)

---

## Workflow F: GitHub Actions

**Step 1.** Read and write the workflow files:
Read file: `~/.claude/skills/pixel-perfect/.github/workflows/visual-tests.yml`
Write it to: `./.github/workflows/visual-tests.yml`

Read file: `~/.claude/skills/pixel-perfect/.github/workflows/update-snapshots.yml`
Write it to: `./.github/workflows/update-snapshots.yml`

**Key requirements:**
- Baselines must be committed to git before running in CI
- `CI=true` is set automatically by GitHub Actions
- Both workflows use `--ipc=host` to prevent Chromium crashes in Docker
- `update-snapshots.yml` must be triggered from a branch (not main if branch protection is on)

## Key Options

| Option | Default | Use |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `maxDiffPixelRatio` | `0` | % pixels allowed to differ (`0.01` = 1%) |
| `threshold` | `0.2` | Per-pixel sensitivity — `0.1` recommended; raise to `0.2` only for font anti-aliasing |
| `mask` | `[]` | Locators to black out (prices, timestamps, live data) |
| `fullPage` | `false` | Capture entire scrollable page |
| `animations` | `'disabled'` | Default — CSS + Web Animations API stopped |

## Quick Commands

```bash
npx playwright test                             # compare vs baseline
npx playwright test --project=Desktop           # specific viewport
npx playwright test tests/visual.spec.ts        # specific file
npx playwright test --update-snapshots          # update changed baselines
npx playwright test --update-snapshots=missing  # only add new baselines
```
